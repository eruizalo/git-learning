If there is any word or concept you do not understand you should take a look at [git glossary].

## 1. Setting your environment
![](resources/icons/docker.png)

We will use [docker],[^docker] so we can have the same isolated environment:

> **Note:** ‚ö†Ô∏è You will need some data of this repo, so you may:
> 1. Download `docker` folder
> 2. Or clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/hablatraining/git-learning.git`

```bash
# Enter to docker folder, previously downloaded
cd docker/
docker build -t training/git .
# If you are not familiar with docker, -v will create a volume inside the docker directory.
#     Whatever you create inside your docker container at projects folder will be at this volume too,
#     so you can see your files and repos from your computer or git clients.
# You may want to delete this argument or change it according your needs.
docker run -it -d -v $(pwd)/git-volume/:/root/projects/ --name learning-git training/git:latest
# Use this command to "enter" your docker container whenever you want
docker exec -it learning-git bash
```
Now, inside your docker, got to **projects/local** folder: `cd projects/local`

> **Note:** Each section will have a synopsis (‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è) of the commands with some useful arguments.
> However, there are more arguments, for more information visit the links of each command.

## 2. Working locally

### 2.1 Starting with git
![](resources/icons/config.png)

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git config [--<scope>] [--show-origin] <name> [<value> [<value-pattern>]]
git config [--<scope>] --add <name> <value>
git config [--<scope>] --unset <name> [<value-pattern>]
git config [--show-origin] [--show-scope] -l | --list
git config [--<scope>] -e | --edit
```
</details>

The [git config] command let us add, remove and show some configurations to customize the way you work with git.
We will also see the following commands to begin with git:
1. The [git init] command creates an empty local git repository. An initial branch without any commits and `.git` folder will be created, where the local git config will be saved.

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git init [-b <branch-name> | --initial-branch=<branch-name>]
         [<directory>]
```
</details>

2. The [git add] command updates the internal git index so the given files will be tracked and prepared to be "committed". A file that has being "added" is also known as a staged file.

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git add [--verbose | -v] [--interactive | -i] [--patch | -p] [--edit | -e]
        [--] [<pathspec>...]
```
</details>

3. The [git commit] command is the one which actually saves the **staged** files.
When you create a new commit you will save the following info among others:
  * The actual changes (only the differences)
  * Who performed the commit
  * When the commit was created
  * The commit parent
  * etc

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git commit [-a | --all] [--interactive] [-p | --patch]
           [-v | --verbose] [--amend] [-m | --message <msg>]
           [--] [<pathspec>...]
```
</details><br>

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
cd projects
ls -l
# First of all, let's say to git who we are and which name should it display
git config --global user.email eduardo.ruiz@hablapps.com
git config --global user.name "Eduardo Ruiz Alonso"

# We can view all the configs anytime
git config --list

# There are some other interesting configs, you will see its potential eventually
git config --global init.defaultBranch main

# Now that git has the minimum configuration, let's start a new project
git init
echo -e "# This is my git project\n" > README.md
echo -e "Cheatsheet: https://devhints.io/git-log-format\n\n" >> README.md
# Now that we have made some changes we will prepare this file to be "saved"
git add .
# The file is prepared and "tracked" by git, now we are going to save it's first version
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Just for you to know, in the first steps we added global configs, but you
#   could also set some local configurations. This means that every repo in
#   this computer will read the global config, but this very repo will have
#   a different configuration.
# Here we will set the same email, but different name, just for learning purposes.
git config user.email eduardo.ruiz@hablapps.com
git config user.name "Eduardo Ruiz"

# Adding some arguments, you could see "where" are the configurations located.
git config --list --show-origin
```
</details>

### 2.2 Tracking files
![](resources/icons/track.png)

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git status [-s | --short] [-b | --branch] [--show-stash]
           [-u[<mode>] |--untracked-files[=<mode>]] [--ignored]
           [--] [<pathspec>...]
```
</details>

The [git status] command shows the differences between the current local repository and the current HEAD commit.
This means, it will show which files have been modified, added or deleted, and it's git state (untracked, modified, deleted, etc.)

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# Let's create a new file, which will be untracked, as it has just been created.
echo "this is a test" > test.txt
# If we execute the git status command, we will see this file as "Not staged"
git status
# Now let's modify a previously tracked file (README.md) and "track" the new file
echo "-----" >> README.md
git add test.txt
# After execute git status we will see the new file as "Changes to be committed"
#    We will also see the README.md file as "not staged", because we made some
#    some changes and they also have to be prepared to be "saved"
git status

# Let's create a new commit, but this time we will use a new argument which will
#    help us to avoid the git add command.
#    If we execute this command with -a argument, tracked files will be automatically staged
git commit -a -m "commit 2"   ## -a ==> ONLY TRACKED FILES
# As we committed everything, git status will show us nothing.
git status

# We have a special file called .gitignore, which will tell git to avoid tracking some files and folders
touch .gitignore
touch .testing
# If we execute git status it will show us both new files
git status
# As .gitignore file is new, it is not being tracked, so let's track it and add config
#   git to ignore "hidden" files (starting with a dot)
git add .gitignore
echo ".*" >> .gitignore
# After executing git status, we will see the tracked .gitignore file, but we will also see changes
#   over this same file that are not (yet) prepared to be committed.
#   Don't you miss something?
#   Exactly, the .testing file disappeared! But if you go to the folder and list everything you will see it.
#   This is happening because this file is being ignored by git, so it simply does not exist for it.
#   Usually ignored files are logs, personal config IDE files... Everything you should not share.
git status
ls -la

# Now that we know how to ignore files let's ignore a also a folder
mkdir secrets
touch secrets/secret1.txt
touch secrets/secret2.txt
# Here we can see a new untracked folder
git status
# Using -u argument is like using --untracked-files=all, so it will show individual files in untracked folders
git status -u
# Now we are using just a few files, but in a real project you could update several files at the same time.
#   Adding -s argument will summarize them in a simple view. Also --ignored files could help you to see ignored files.
git status -u -s -b --ignored
echo "secrets/*" >> .gitignore
git status
git commit -am "gitignore"

# Let's see a common use case. Imagine you create a new test file
touch test.scala
# But, when you execute your test, it creates a log file you don't realize.
echo "2022-04......" > myTest.log
# You think you have finished your work, and you only have created a test file... So you add everything and commit it.
git add .
git commit -m "add script"
# Eventually you realize that there are some files that shouldn't be there (in this case, the log file).
#   As I told you... If I want to ignore a file I simply add it in our .gitignore file, so let's do it.
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
# If we create a new log file it will be ignored
touch myLog.log
git commit -am "ignore log files"
# Everything looks fine, doesn't it? So you just execute the test, updating the log file...
echo "2022-05......" > myTest.log
# And you see how your repo is going using git status...
git status
# Why the f*%k the log file is still there?!?
# Simple: we added the config to ignore .log files... But this file was being tracked before we added this config.
# This log file was part of the repository, it is in the git history, so git keeps tracking it.
# We have to remove it from the tracking history.
# In order to ease this step and learn a something new, let's discard the not saved changes
git checkout .
# Now, let's untrack the log file and see what we have done
git rm --cached myTest.log
git status
# Git status show us that we deleted the file, BUT, if you take a look, the file is still there.
#   This means exactly the same we saw before, the file exists, but it doesn't for git.
ls -l
# If we "save" this new state "removing" the file, future changes will not be tracked.
git commit -m "untrack myTest.log"
echo "#bash" >> edu.sh
git status


# WARNING!: This steps allow us to stop tracking files, BUT the files remain in the git history.
#   We will see the git history in detail in the next sections.
#   If you want to completely remove a file from the git history, this steps are not what you are looking.
```

### 2.3 Log & alias

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git log
      [<options>]
        [--graph] [--abbrev-commit] [--decorate]
        [-n <number> | -<number>] [--format='<format>']
        [--all] [--branches=<pattern>] [--no-merges]
      [<revision-range>]
      [[--] <path>...]
```
</details>

The [git log] command shows the git commit history.
This command is highly customizable, you can limit the number of commits, select a range, show it like a tree format, etc.

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
echo "Something" >> README.md

### 2.4 HEAD, relative references & branch creation and repositioning
![](resources/icons/branch.png)

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git branch [--format=<format>]
           [(-r | --remotes) | (-a | --all)]
           [--list] [<pattern>...]
git branch [-f] <branchname> [<start-point>]
git branch (--set-upstream-to=<upstream> | -u <upstream>) [<branchname>]
git branch --unset-upstream [<branchname>]
git branch (-m | --move   | -M) [<oldbranch>] <newbranch>
git branch (-c | --copy   | -C) [<oldbranch>] <newbranch>
git branch [-d | --delete | -D] <branchname>...
```
</details>

The [git branch] command list or manage branches.

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git checkout [<branch>/<commit>]
git checkout [[-b|-B] <new-branch>] [<start-point>]
git checkout (-p|--patch) [--] [<pathspec>...]
```
</details>

The [git checkout] command let us move between branches and restore files (discarding not committed changes).

In git, you are always somewhere in the git history. That means, you are always seeing a commit, in the git history.
**HEAD** is the pointer to the current commit you are viewing. Every time you switch from one branch to another,
your **HEAD** moves from one branch to the other.

Now we know the concept of branch & HEAD, we will see how to switch from/to them.
But what if I want to position git to two commits before "main"? Do I need to show the log
and create a new branch from the commit I copy/paste?
No need for that, we can also move from git history using "~" and "^" characters.

When we use "~" character we mean "the first father of". We can tell git where we start looking and how many commits
behind should we reposition our HEAD. This means:
* HEAD~ --> The first parent of HEAD
* main~~ --> Two parents behind main
* main~4 --> Four parents behind main, === main~~~~

When we use "^" character we also mean "the first father of", but in a non-linear way.
It is usually used on merge commits, because in git we can have several parents (usually two).
This means:
* HEAD^ --> The first parent of HEAD, === HEAD~ for a commit with only one parent
* main^^ --> Two parents behind main, === main~~ === main~2 for commits with only one parent
* main^2 --> The second parent from main =!= main~2

We can also Take a look to the following examples:

| Example  | Result                 |
| -------- | ---------------------- |
|HEAD^     | is the `K` commit      |
|HEAD~1    | is also the `K` commit |
|HEAD^^    | is the `I` commit      |
|HEAD~^    | is also the `I` commit |
|HEAD~2    | is also the `I` commit |
|HEAD~^2   | is the `J` commit      |
|HEAD~^^   | is the `H` commit      |
|HEAD~3    | is also the `H` commit |
|HEAD~4^~  | is the `C` commit      |
|HEAD~4^2~ | is the `D` commit      |

git tag [-a] [-f] [-m <msg>] <tagname> [<commit> | <object>]
git tag -d <tagname>...
git tag -l | --list [-i | --ignore-case] [--sort=<key>] [--format=<format>] [<pattern>...]
```
</details>

The [git tag] command let us manage special references called tags.
You may wonder what's the difference between branches and tags: both references
some point of the git history, but branches are "active" lines of development
while tags do not evolve and are used to mark special moments of the git history,
like a release version.

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# With the next command we will create a new branch called "branch1" from HEAD
git branch branch1
# If we don't specify any argument, it will list local branches
git branch
# Checkout command allow us to move from our current branch to "branch1"
git checkout branch1
# If we list again current branches you will se now there is an indicator at "branch1"
git branch
# We can also create a new branch using checkout command if we use -b argument
git checkout -b branch2
git branch
git logtree

# Let's create one commit for each branch and unify them (merge) so we can see some relative positions
echo "commit 3" >> README.md
git commit -am "commit 3"
git checkout branch1

echo "commit 4" >> tests.txt
git commit -am "commit 4"
# Let me use the merge command, but we will see it  in detail on a further section
git merge branch2
git logtree

# Now that we have "branch2" with a single commit, and "branch1" with it's own commit and a new commit
#     coming from "branch2", we can do interesting things to create new branches from relative positions.
# First of all, let's create a branch called "ref"
git branch ref
# We can also create a branch from other branch
git branch main ref2
# But what if we already have a branch and it is not in the correct position?
# We can "move" the reference of a branch so we can reposition that branch.
# To achieve that, we have to use -f flag. That means we FORCE the creation of a branch
#   somewhere in the git history, if the branch exists, overwrite it.
git branch main ref # This will fail, for ref already exists.
git branch -f main ref
git logtree

# We can also create branches from relative positions
git checkout main
git branch -f ref HEAD~1
git branch -f refParen1 main^1
git branch -f refParen2 main^2
git logtree

# Or even from a commit hash or any other reference
git branch newBranch commit_hash
git logtree

# Let's conclude this section watching tags in action.
# using git tag command we can create a tag from HEAD
git tag v0.0.2
# But we can also create a tag anywhere from the git history using branch names, relative references, commit hashes, etc.
git tag v0.0.1 main~3
# Using git tag command without arguments we can list our local tags
git tag
# This command let us sort and filter tags as well
git tag -l --sort=-creatordate --format='%(creatordate:short):  %(refname:short)'
# Or you can use git log
git log --no-walk --tags --pretty="%ai || %h || %an ||%d" --decorate=full
# The same way we can create a branch from another branch, we can create a branch from a tag
git branch release/v0.0.1 v0.0.1

### 2.6 Stashing
![](resources/icons/stash.png)

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git stash list [<log-options>]
git stash show [-u|--include-untracked|--only-untracked] [<diff-options>] [<stash>]
git stash drop [-q|--quiet] [<stash>]
git stash ( pop | apply ) [-q|--quiet] [<stash>]
git stash branch <branchname> [<stash>]
git stash [push [-p|--patch] [-S|--staged]
          [-u|--include-untracked] [-a|--all] [-m|--message <message>]
          [--] [<pathspec>...]]
git stash clear
git stash create [<message>]
```
</details>

The [git stash] command saves our working changes into a "temporal commit".

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# In order to see why we may need the git stash command let's create a branch and make some changes.
git checkout -b feature/myFeature
echo "some changes" >> README.md
# We just created a branch from main, so we can move from/to main freely, because we are at the same point.
git checkout main
# Consider you save your changes, so main now is a commit ahead from our branch...
# Let's switch back and make other changes, in the same position
git commit -am "main changes"
git checkout feature/myFeature
echo "other changes" >> README.md
# What so you think it will happen if we try to switch back to main?
git checkout main
# As you have noticed, our last command failed. We have some working changes and, at the same time, we are trying to move to other branch,
#   but this branch has other modifications at the same line, so git does not know if you want to discard
#   your working changes and keep the line at head, or to overwrite the "main" modification with your working changes.
git st
# Imagine this is not a finished development, but you still want to go to main to, I don't know, to review something before continuing.
# git stash helps us to save temporarily our work, so our working directory will be clean and we could switch branches.
git stash
git checkout main
# Eureka! git saved our changes and we could switch branches.
git checkout feature/myFeature
# But where are my changes? If I use git log I can't see them
git log -n 1
# As we talked before, stash saves a special temporal "commit", so it is not in the git history.
# We can list our stashes using the following command
git stash list

# git stash command saves this changes in a pile, named stash@{n}, where n is the position in the pile.
# Using pop git will extract the saved changes to our working directory and delete this stash reference
git stash pop stash@{0}
git stash list
# Let's save it again so we can practice other commands
git stash
# If we want to extract our stash, but not to delete the stash reference we could use apply (this is useful
#     if we suspect the stash may conflict with our HEAD)
git stash apply stash@{0}
# Let's delete this changes and make a new one to see how a new stash will look
git checkout .
echo "other changes2" >> README.md
git stash
# We now have two elements in our stash pile, so the new stash will be stash@{0}, and the previous stash will be stash@{1}
git stash list
# Please, do not trust me, let's check it out
git stash show -p stash@{0}
git stash show -p stash@{1}

# We can also save stashes with a message so it will be easier to know what we were doing
git stash -m "WIP feature my stash"
git stash list
# We can delete our stashes anytime using drop
git stash drop stash@{0}
# If we do not specify any stash, it will use the last one (stash@{0})
git stash show -p
```
</details>

### 2.7 Rollback changes
![](resources/icons/rollback.png)

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git revert [--no-edit] [-n | --no-commit] [-m parent-number] <commit>...
git revert (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit)
```
</details>

The [git revert] command takes back the modifications made by some commit or commits.
It also discards added changes (we have been used this command as the `unstage` alias).

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git reset [--patch | -p] [<tree-ish>] [--] [<pathspec>...]
git reset [--soft | --mixed | --hard] [<commit>]
```
</details>

The [git reset] command repositions our HEAD to the given reference.
‚ö†Ô∏è This command rewrites the git history, so be careful when using it.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state Revert {
        direction BT
        [*] --> +A
        +A --> +B
        +B --> +C
        +C --> A
        +A --> A: Undo changes\n(new commit)
    }
    state Reset {
        direction BT
        [*] --> Z
        Z --> Y
        Y --> W
        W --> Z: Go back in history\nremoving Y and W
    }
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant w as Working directory
    participant s as Staging area
    participant r as Local/Remote repository
    rect rgb(191, 223, 255)
    note over w,r: git reset --soft
    r->>s: download/delete + stage
    s->>s: remain
    w->>w: remain
    end
    rect rgb(191, 223, 255)
    note over w,r: git reset --mixed
    r->>w: download/delete + unstage
    s->>w: unstage
    w->>w: remain
    end
    rect rgb(191, 223, 255)
    note over w,r: git reset --hard
    r->>w: download/delete
    s--xw: unstage + delete
    w--xw: delete
    note right of w: untracked files will remain
    end
```

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# First of all we will make some commits, as if we were developing and accidentally messed up
git checkout -b reverts main
echo -e "\n\nthis will not fail\n" >> README.md
git commit -am "this will not fail"
echo -e "\n\nbut this one will\n" >> README.md
git commit -am "but this one will"
git logtree
# We have saved our work and now we see we did something completely wrong.
# We need to fix it, but it will take time to know what is happening, and fix it,
#     we can't block our mates while we resolve this problem... So we "commit back" our blunder
git revert HEAD
git logtree
git show HEAD
# Like other commands, we can tell to git any kind of reference to revert
git revert --no-commit main..main~
git logtree
# But what happens when we try to revert something and we get a conflict or it simply fails?
git checkout main
git revert reverts~2
# We tried to revert a commit that made changes that we do not have, so we have to solve this situation
git diff HEAD
# In this case we will abort the revert
git revert --abort

# We have other ways to "fix" our git history. Here we will see reset command, but,
#     unlike the revert command, which creates a new commit, reset goes back in history
#     and we have different ways to do so
git checkout -b resets
git logtree
# Using soft argument we will go back in history, but all the changes made in our commits
#     will be staged
git reset --soft HEAD~3
git logtree
git status -vv
# Let's create a new commit with the same changes so we can see what happens when
#     we use the mixed argument, which is more or less the same, but our changes
#     will not be staged
git commit -am "this too 2"
git reset --mixed HEAD~1
git logtree
git status -vv
# If we repeat our commit to try out the hard argument. When we use the hard argument
#     our branch is repositioned, as before, but our tracked changes are discarded.
#     This is useful to reposition our branches, but be careful not to delete sensitive changes.
git commit -am "this too 3"
git reset --hard HEAD~1
git logtree
git status -vv
# Like we previously did with revert and other commands, reset let us select any kind of reference.
git reset --hard main
git logtree
git reset --hard <COMMIT ID DELETED BRANCH>
git logtree
```
</details>

### 2.8 Amending
![](resources/icons/amend.png)

Previously we saw the [git commit] command, but there is an argument that needs a special mention: `amend`.
‚ö†Ô∏è This argument rewrites the last commit, so, as other commands that rewrites the git history, be careful.
Anyway, this option let us clean our git history if we see something wrong or to improve.

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# Let's do something wrong
git checkout main
echo -e "\nDis is som text\n" >> README.md
git commit -am "Adding something at readme"
git logtree
# After we commit we see the error, so let's fix it before anyone else saw it
head -n -3 README.md > README.md
echo -e "\nThis is some text\n" >> README.md
# Now that everything looks fine, we will rewrite the last commit.
#     Amend let us to update a commit, a commit message or both.
git commit -am "Adding something at readme(fixed)" --amend
git logtree
# In the git history now we can see the new git commit (new hash & message)

# It's important to say we can amend others commit, but the author
#     will be the same, but the committer will be updated.
git config user.name "Mr. X"
git commit -am "Fixing readme 2" --amend
git config user.name "Eduardo Ruiz Alonso"
git log --pretty=fuller -n 2
```
</details>

### 2.9 Cherry picking
![](resources/icons/cherrypick.png)

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git cherry-pick [--edit] [-n | --no-commit] [-x] [--ff] <commit>...
git cherry-pick (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit)
```
</details>

The [git cherry-pick] command copies other commit or commits.
This is useful when you, or someone else, have something useful in other branch,
and you need it, but you don't need the whole branch.

```mermaid
flowchart BT
    subgraph master
    A --> B
    end
    B --> f21 & f11
    f21 --> f21'
    subgraph feature1
    f11-->f21'
    end
    subgraph feature2
    f21-->f22
    end
```

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# Let's create the situation we saw before: two branches, and in one branch we have
#     a commit that we need in the other.
git checkout -b feature/myOtherFeature main
echo -e "MyClass()\n" > MyClass.scala
git add .
git commit -m "Add class"
echo "Utilities()" > utils.scala
git add utils.scala
git commit -m "add utils"
# branch 2 (where we will need the utility)
git checkout -b feature/myOtherFeature2 main
echo -e "MyClass2()\n" > MyClass2.scala
git add MyClass2.scala
git commit -m "[+] MyClass2"
git logtree

# Now we will copy the commit from one branch to the other
git cherry-pick -x feature/myOtherFeature
git logtree
git show HEAD

# Like other commands, if we do something "strange" we need to fix it before
#     we can continue with this command
git reset --hard HEAD~1
echo -e "MyClass() extends SomeThing\n" > MyClass.scala
git add .
git commit -m "same class"
# The cherry-pick copies a commit, probably made from someone else, so if you cherry-pick
#     a commit, the author will be the same, but the commiter will be you.
git config user.name "Mr. X"
git cherry-pick -x feature/myOtherFeature~1
# This time we will edit and fix the cherry-pick, then use continue
git add .
git cherry-pick --continue
git logtree
git log --pretty=fuller -n 2
git config user.name "Eduardo Ruiz"
```
</details>

### 2.10 Branch integration (merge & rebase)
![](resources/icons/branch_compare.png)

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git merge [--no-commit] [--squash] [--ff | --no-ff | --ff-only]
          [-m <msg>] [<commit>...]
git merge (--continue | --abort | --quit)
```
</details>

The [git merge] command joins two or more branches. Usually, you will only see a merge from two branches.

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git rebase [-i | --interactive] [--onto <newbase> | --keep-base]
          [--no-ff] [<upstream> [<branch>] | <branch>]
git rebase (--continue | --skip | --abort | --quit | --edit-todo | --show-current-patch)
```
</details>

The [git rebase] command move and/or manage a set of commits to another base.
If we have a branches A & B(HEAD), it is like we create A' as temporal branch
and take the commits from A, one by one, and apply a cherry-pick or amend over B,
then delete A and rename A' to A.
‚ö†Ô∏è This command rewrites the git history, so be careful.

Initial

    "nodeSpacing": 100,
    "nodeRadius": 5

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# Let's make some modifications to explain the merge command
git checkout feature/myOtherFeature
echo -e "some code here...\n" >> MyClass.scala
git commit -am "some code"
# He updated a file, but this file is only in this branch,
#     so if we go to main this file does not exist.
git checkout main
ls -l
# The way we have being working, if we simply merge it will "fast-forward" merge.
# Let's not let this situation, so we can see common merges.
# We will explain this later if we have time.
git merge --no-ff feature/myOtherFeature
git logtree
ls -l
# As we can see in the log, a new commit was created from our branch to main.
#     This commit contains all of our changes
# Let's rollback this situation, because, like other commands, merge may result
#     in conflicting results... Let's see them and abort them
git reset --hard HEAD~1
echo "Some class" > MyClass.scala
git add .
git commit -m "some class"
git merge --no-ff feature/myOtherFeature
git merge --abort

# Another interesting argument is squash. This allow us to consolidate all our
#     commits into a single commit.
git merge --squash feature/myOtherFeature
git commit -m "merge feature/myOtherFeature -> main"
git logtree
ls -l

# Let's prepare main to see how rebase works
git reset --hard HEAD~1
echo "before rebase" >> README.md
git commit -am "before rebase"
# NOTE: while merge "brings" changes, rebase moves changes.
#     This means: if we want to merge something into main, our HEAD must be at main,
#     but if we want to rebase main, our HEAD must be at our branch.
git checkout feature/myOtherFeature2
git backup
git rebase main
# DONE!!
git logtree
# As we can see, now our branch is ahead of main, and we have the "same"
#     commits (we now have new hashes, committer is updated, etc)

# But why to use rebase if I still have to merge my branch into main?
#     Consider the situation of someone making an improvement or a fix and it is
#     already merged into main. A rebase helps you to test your code against
#     the last version, avoiding unused code, or fixing tests before merging.
git reset --hard backup/feature/myOtherFeature2
# In order to see conflicts while rebasing and show the risks and the potential
#     of this command we will merge feature/myOtherFeature into main

## 3. Working with remotes
![](resources/icons/github.png)![](resources/icons/gitlab.png)![](resources/icons/bitbucket.png)

In this section we will see how to work in a team using git.

### 3.1 Cloning a remote repository

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git clone [-v | --verbose] [-l | --local]
          [--depth <depth>] [--[no-]single-branch] [--no-tags]
          [-o | --origin <name>] [-b | --branch <name>]
          [--] <repository> [<directory>]
```
</details>

The [git clone] command copies a repository into a new directory.
Probably you will only use this command to download a repo from a remote repository to your local computer,
but it is also commonly used when you have to manage CI/CD[^CI/CD] pipelines.

We will also take a look at [git remote] command, which let us manage links between local and remote repositories.

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git remote [-v | --verbose]
git remote add [-t <branch>] [-f] [--[no-]tags] <name> <URL>
git remote rename <old> <new>
git remote remove <name>
git remote set-url --add [--push] <name> <newurl>
git remote set-url --delete [--push] <name> <URL>
git remote [-v | --verbose] show [-n] <name>...
```
</details>

Let's clone this very same repo and see the firsts commands we can use while working int a team.

```bash
cd ~/projects
git clone https://github.com/eruizalo/git-learning.git
cd git-learning
# How can I see where I cloned this repo?
git remote
# Let's see a bit more
git remote show origin
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è **GitHub support for password authentication was removed on August 13, 2021.**:
> Let's create a Personal Token Access ([PAT]) following the official documentation.

### 3.2 Working with others 1 (fetching)
<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git fetch [--all] [-v | --verbose]
         [--no-commit] [-e | --edit] [--ff-only]
         [--squash] [--autostash]
         [<repository> [<refspec>...]]
```
</details>

The [git fetch] command syncs your local and remote repositories, so if new tags or branches have been created or updated,
now will be visible and available to work with them.

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# Speaker will create a new branch
# Now we will use the git branch command using -a argument, to list all branches (local + remote)
git branch -a
# But I still see only my branch.. Why?
# Because the new branch was created after you cloned the repo, so your copy does not contain that reference
# If we fetch our remote now we will download 
git fetch     # As you can see here, git will warn us about new branches or other changes
# Now if we take a look again we can see the new branch
git branch -a
# Remember to use -a argument to list local & remote branches
git branch
# Or if you are only interested in remote branches use -r argument
git branch -r
```

</details>

Let's stop here, for now. Add this alias, and we will see how it works later.

> üéÅ‚ôªÔ∏è **_Cool alias:_**  `git config --global alias.sync = fetch origin main:main`

### 3.3 Working with others 2 (pull-push)
<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git pull [--tags] [-v | --verbose]
         [--no-commit] [-e | --edit] [--ff-only]
         [--squash] [--autostash]
         [<repository> [<refspec>...]]
```
</details>

The [git pull] command is used to sync and download content from a remote repository.
Under the hood, `git pull` is a making the following steps for you:
1. [git fetch]: Sync local & remote repo histories scoped to the local branch that `HEAD` is pointed at
2. [git merge] / [git rebase]: Git will reconcile the diverging branches (local/remote), if needed

So let's say you have cloned some time ago a repo, you are at main but your team have been working on this repo, but you didn't.
Your main branch will be behind several commits. If you perform a `git pull` command it will fetch + rebase your main branch:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A --- B[B,\n main]
   B --- C
   C --- E
   E --- F[F,\n origin/main]
   B -.-> |pull|F
```
After:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A --- B
   B --- C
   C --- E
   E --- F[F,\n origin/main,\n main]
   B -.-> |pull|F
```

But, what would have happened if you have been working over your main branch, or you are on another branch, and you want to "sync" it with main
```mermaid
flowchart LR
   A --- B
   B --- C
   B --- D[D,\n main]
   C --- E
   E --- F[F,\n origin/main]
   D --- H
   F -.-> |pull|H
```

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

```bash
# --> Download develop changes only if your develop hasn't changed
git pull --ff-only origin main
```
</details><br>

<details><summary>‚ÑπÔ∏è‚ö°‚ÑπÔ∏è Synopsis</summary>

```bash
git push [--tags] [--porcelain] [-v | --verbose]
         [-f | --force] [-d | --delete]
         [<repository> [<refspec>...]]
```
</details>

The [git push] command TODO

<details><summary>üößLet's practice</summary>

### 3.4 Multiple remotes (forking)

### 3.5 Force push

### 3.6 Tracking your branches
```bash
# rename a pushed branch
# push branch 1 (local) to branch 2 (remote)
```

### 3.7 Pull Requests (PRs)
